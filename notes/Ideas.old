It would be nice if worship checked that you had the same requirements
as mastery does instead of checking for the mastery bit.  Some of the
classes don't have a mastery in place yet...

Subject blink~
Text
any chance blink can be looked at? its really laggy
and makes it hard to use any other skills after you blink.
makes it a pain to use during a fight when the person
your fighting against can use a couple skills in the time
your able to do anything again.

Can you please made take_item put the items in the character's inventory
instead of dropping them to the ground.  Also could you let us quest nodrop

Dragon's gas breath is insanely expensive in terms of mana
