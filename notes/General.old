Let me start off by first saying that I really 
enjoy your mud. I've been having a lot of fun 
and for the most part the people are friendly 
and helpyfull. But there is one person that I
feel is crossing the line. Bongzilla is going 
out of his was to make my life no this mud a 
living hell. The first time he killed me, I was 
lagging really bad, but I had 1 status and I 
understand why he killed me. Now I said some 
unfriendly things but now he is morting me just 
because. Can you please some how stop this or 
I don't see the point in playing here. As few 
people that play muds now a days it might be a 
good idea to keep the people who do play happy. 
So please let me know if there is anything you c
an do to stop him from being an Asshole. Or please 
let me know if your just not going to do anything.
Thank you for your time,
Mackie

I'm stuck as a human, even if I racedetox it just tells me
I already have a race when I try to choose a new one. At a

it won't detox from. I could be wrong though, I dunno.
 
I request it be fixed though. :( I wanna be something

Hey... Fuck you all... Especially you! You're a pathetic waste of fucking
air, and this mud you're playing on is a worthless sloppy peice of shit that
I would call a waste of bandwidth before I ever called it an actual mud..
It's no supprise to me that nobody plays here, even the owner hasn't logged
on in almost a month.. Everything about this place says "Sloppy, Copycoding"
objs  well as "Idiotic owner who probably was just a player who wanted his
own place to fuck up"... In any case, your mud fucking sucks.. All I do
here is bot and speak the truth about just how fucking sloppy this mud is.
I would ask for somebody to prove me wrong, but the fact that I'm like
1/3rd the pbase, with 1 char, speaks for itself...
 
In short.. FUCK YOU you cock sucking fail ass owner bitch. Xrakisis, maybe
if you enlisted the help of people who actually know what they are doing
and step the fuck down as owner you might see a rise in the pbase again...
 
My last note before I post this will be:
WHAT THE FUCK KING OF CHANGE IS A GOD DAMN CALCULATOR COMMAND?!
ARE YOU FUCKING RETARTED? EVERY VIABLE MEANS OF MUDDING HAS A
CALCULATOR BUILT INTO IT... AND YOUR CALCULATOR CAN'T EVEN DO
COMPLEX PROBLEMS... IT'S BASICALLY 1 STEP BETTER THAN COUNTING
ON YOUR FINGERS... ALTHOUGH YOUR FINGERS CAN DO EVEN MORE COMPLEX
CALCULATIONS THAN UR FAIL ASS CODE...
