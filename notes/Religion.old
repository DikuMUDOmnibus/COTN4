Subject Ghoul swampwalk move costs~
Text
Ghouls travel command, swampwalk, coats enormous amount of moves (1500)
compared to other classes that have none or very little (250)
it is very difficult to play when we have to sit around
to wait for our moves to regen
Please remove or fix this problem for Ghouls to be more balanced
thank you very much
