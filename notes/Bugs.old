I think soul weaps are messed up. I'm using them to weapon train
and I keep getting this message.. You are unable to enchant this weapon.
it shows up a ton when using superberserk and it wasn't
showing up before I used soul weaps, so I figure
they are the reason.

Text
So anyways, a while ago I forged ivory hilts on to my weapons and got
Cure Serious on them.  I dealt with it but just realized I am now
cursing myself... :)
 
Curse.
You are affected by:
Spell: 'cure serious' modifies save vs spell by 1 for 227 hours with bits curse.
Spell: 'cure serious' modifies hit roll by -1 for 227 hours with bits curse.
 
 
Just a small bug, probably a skill_table[] error...

ok, now I'm suddenly getting good exp. In rooms where
I was getting about 300k-350k average exp a room, I'm
now suddenly getting about 750k. Not sure what changed
or why I'm getting exp like that now.
Maybe it was giving the minimum amount of exp for awhile
or no double exp or something?

seems to have something wrong with it. Seth tried using

so you are unable to train it.
